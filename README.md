This is a repeat challenge from DLAI3: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dlai3). Please watch out for another challenge from DLAI5 soon.
<br>
### Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic has been gripping much of the world recently. Although there have been much efforts gone into developing affordable testing for the masses, it has been shown that the established and widely available chest x-rays (CXR) may be used as a screening criteria. Thanks to the dedicated work by various individuals and organizations, publicly available chest x-rays of COVID-19 subjects are available for analytic usage. This challenge is a continuation from the CSC532 Machine Learning course projects from the School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), which provided the mini-dataset and the dataset of annotated CXR images.

#### Goal
The following is the premise for this challenge:
<br>
Come up with a model that can accurately classify between covid/non-covid affected chest X-rays.

### Accuracy score of model on challenge task:
The model has acheived 96% accuracy on challenge tasks.
